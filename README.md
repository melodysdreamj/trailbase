## Project Structure & Releases

This repository contains all components that make up TrailBase including client
libraries, tests, documentation and examples.
Only the [benchmarks](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase-benchmark) are
kept separately due to their external dependencies.

Pre-built static binaries are available as
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase/releases/) for
Linux, MacOS and Windows.
On Windows the Docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/trailbase/trailbase) can
be used.

Client packages for various languages are available via:

- [JavaScript/TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/trailbase)
- [Dart/Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/trailbase)
- [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/trailbase-client)
- [C#/.Net](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TrailBase/)
- [Python](https://pypi.org/project/trailbase/)

## Running

You can get TrailBase either as a pre-built static binary (MacOS &
Linux), run it using [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/trailbase/trailbase)
(Windows, MacOS, Linux, ...), or [build](#building) it from source.

The latest pre-built binaries can be downloaded from [GitHub
releases](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase/releases/) and run via:

```bash
$ ./trail run
```

Thanks to `trail` being a single static binary, there's no need to install
anything including system dependencies.
This also means that you can confidently update your system and deploy to
different machines without having to worry about prior set-up or shared
library compatibility.

Using [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/trailbase/trailbase), you can run the
following, which will also create and mount a local `./traildepot` asset
directory:

```bash
$ mkdir traildepot
$ alias trail="docker run -p 4000:4000 --mount type=bind,source=$PWD/traildepot,target=/app/traildepot trailbase/trailbase /app/trail"
$ trail run
```

To get a full list of commands, simply run `trail --help` .

## Building

If you have all the necessary dependencies (Rust, protobuf, node.js, pnpm)
installed, you can build TrailBase by running:

```bash
# Windows only: make sure to enable symlinks (w/o `mklink` permissions for your
# user, git will fall back to copies).
$ git config core.symlinks true && git reset --hard

# Download necessary git sub-modules.
$ git submodule update --init --recursive

# Install Javascript dependencies first. Required for the next step.
$ pnpm install

# Build the main executable. Adding `--release` will build a faster release
# binary but slow down the build significantly.
$ cargo build --bin trail
```

To build a static binary you'll need to explicitly specify the target platform,
e.g. Linux using the GNU glibc:

```bash
$ RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+crt-static" cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --release
```

Alternatively, if you want to build a Docker image or don't have to deal with
build dependencies, you can simply run:

```bash
# Download necessary git sub-modules.
$ git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build the container as defined in `Dockerfile`.
$ docker build . -t trailbase
```

## Contributing

Contributions are very much appreciated üôè. For anything beyond bug fixes,
let's briefly chat to see how a proposal fits into the overall roadmap and
avoid any surprises.

We're not sure yet what the best setup or exact license is for compatibility
between OSL-3.0 and more popular licenses or use as a framework.
So we'd ask you to sign a simple CLA that retains your copyright, ensures that
TrailBase will continue to forever be freely available under an OSI-approved
copyleft license, while allowing for some flexibility and sub-licensing as
established by much larger, successful projects such as Grafana or Element.

## License

TrailBase is licensed under the [Open Software License 3.0 (OSL-3.0)](https://opensource.org/licenses/OSL-3.0).
For the full license text as included in this project and our detailed interpretation, please see our [Official License Page](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase/blob/main/docs/src/content/docs/license.md).

**Our Intent & Your Application:**

We chose OSL-3.0 because its definition of "derivative work" is intended to be narrow, covering modifications _to the TrailBase core software itself_.

This means:

- If you **modify or extend the TrailBase core library source code**, those changes fall under OSL-3.0 and must also be shared under OSL-3.0.
- If you **use TrailBase with your application** ‚Äì for example, by using our client-side libraries (for web, mobile, etc.), writing server-side hooks and functions executed by TrailBase, or utilizing TrailBase for static web hosting ‚Äì **your application and its original code are NOT considered derivative works of TrailBase.** Therefore, you are **not** required to license your project under OSL-3.0 or disclose its source code due to merely using TrailBase. The OSL-3.0's copyleft provision does not apply to your original work in these scenarios.

This approach is similar in spirit to the "library" or "linkage" exceptions found in licenses like LGPL, or the "classpath exception" for GPL. The goal is to allow you to build on top of TrailBase without the copyleft provisions of OSL-3.0 applying to your original work.

**Disclaimer:**
We are not lawyers, and this is not legal advice. The above reflects our understanding and intent. For a detailed legal explanation of OSL-3.0, please refer to resources like the one provided by [Rosen Law](https://rosenlaw.com/OSL3.0-explained.htm) or consult your own legal counsel.

If you require an
[exception](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling-exceptions.html), reach out
to contact@trailbase.io.
